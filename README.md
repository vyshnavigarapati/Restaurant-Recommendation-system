# Restaurant-Recommendation-system
A restaurant recommendation system suggests places to eat based on user preferences, location, and reviews. It uses data like cuisine, price, ratings, and ambiance to provide personalized suggestions.
This project, Restaurant Recommendation System, is designed to suggest the most suitable restaurants to users based on their preferences, location, and past behavior using machine learning and data analysis techniques. The main goal is to enhance user experience by providing personalized restaurant recommendations similar to popular food platforms.
The system uses a dataset containing restaurant details such as name, location, cuisine type, ratings, price range, and reviews. The data is cleaned and preprocessed to handle missing values and textual inconsistencies. Various recommendation techniques are implemented, including:
Content-Based Filtering: Recommends restaurants similar to those the user has liked, based on features such as cuisine, location, and ratings.
Collaborative Filtering: Suggests restaurants by analyzing the preferences and behavior of users with similar tastes.
Hybrid Approach: Combines both methods to improve recommendation accuracy and personalization.
The project also includes data visualization to understand user preferences and restaurant trends. Evaluation metrics like Cosine Similarity, RMSE, and Precision@K are used to measure the system’s performance and accuracy.
